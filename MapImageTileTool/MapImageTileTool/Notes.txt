MegaBuilder(working title) Design Notes:


Aspect Ratio:
all maps all scales maintain aspect ratio of 18x12 (best fit for TTS's scale 18units = 1 inch)
dimensionFactor: dimensionAspect x scale 
stretch/compress: get both width/length and choose the one closest to their aspectFactor, change other measurement to stay in ratio
fill: add blank pixels to complete map to fit ratio
fill will meet default size or resolution one size above

5400 x 3600 (30 ppi)
3600 x 2400 (20 ppi) - default map resolution

Adding Maps:
save all map information in text file:

(Map Name)
(Scale)
(Width in Maps)
(Height in Maps)
(OffsetX)
(OffsetY)

edit map option to change these variables or the map to tile

Map Scale:
maps are contained in folders, folders contain JSON file that holds scale information and map info
going up and down a "zlevel" will go to next available scale

Map Info:
map sets save all the information for map and scale
mapObjects are created when image is tiled and added to JSONArray

TTS Tiling:
each image has its own tile, JSON array will be used to select map, Z-level, and grid area
main display board must be tracked and swapped
